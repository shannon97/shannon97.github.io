## Project Requirements

### Content
My portfolio site includes a profile picture with a biography that has the content sitting within a dropdown. My contact button is anchored to the form at the bottom of the page. The form is also set up with required fields and is actioned with Form Spree to send an email to me. My Recent Work (Projects) section is where future work will go. I have linked out to my Instagram and LinkedIn profiles with the icons in my nav area. 
- [x] At least one profile picture
- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] Functional Contact Form
- [x] "Projects" section
- [x] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.


### Technical
I currently have 4 href links to their own html pages (no content inside apart from background, nav, and coming soon text). This is currently uploaded on GitHub pages and was pushed through using GitBash. I have used the iPhone 12 Pro size to test my responsiveness - I also did desktop first.. (sorry) and added a media query for mobile devices. 
- [x] At least 2 web pages.
- [x] Version controlled with Git
- [x] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [x] Implements responsive design principles.

### Bonus (optional)
I have added a pointer curser for my clickable areas when moused over. My 4 href links in my Recent Work area also change colour when hovered over. 
- [x] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your sit
